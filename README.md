## lab 2  
Context    
Step 1: Use a LangChain wrapper class for converting functions into Tools.   
Convert a Serper API function into a tool to search content from websites with google search API.   
Convert a push function into a tool to send a notification to a pushover app on my phone.  
Step 2: Integrate the tools created from step 1 with LangGraph and LLMs to create a chatbox shown in the screenshot below.  
The same question from the lab 1 is asked but the chatbox could answer it this time more accurately. The chatbox could send a notification to a pushover app as requested.
